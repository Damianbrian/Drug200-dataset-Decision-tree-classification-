# Drug Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm

This project demonstrates how to use a decision tree classifier to predict the type of drug a patient should be prescribed based on their medical data. The project involves splitting the dataset into training and test sets, training the decision tree model, and making predictions for new patient data.

## Overview

The dataset used in this project contains patient information such as:
- **Age**: The age of the patient.
- **Sex**: The gender of the patient.
- **Blood Pressure (BP)**: The blood pressure level of the patient (e.g., HIGH, NORMAL, LOW).
- **Cholesterol**: The cholesterol level of the patient (e.g., HIGH, NORMAL).
- **Na_to_K**: The ratio of sodium to potassium in the patientâ€™s blood.

The target variable is the type of drug prescribed to the patient, and the aim is to build a model that predicts the drug based on the input features.
